"""
X figure out dev stuff
X make a trainer class
- run on cluster
X no stim input onehot !!! should get cleaner reps
- save train/test split
- logging + tensorboard logging; save logits not choices
- function to move between A/B binary and one-hot representations
- mechanism to remove block switching (time with epoch starts only)
- general formulation of rnn: one for standard, one for groupRNN
- better logger: want to log model, environment, and curriculum, training params
- checkpointing of models
- save scripts?
- curriculum for dropout annealing?
